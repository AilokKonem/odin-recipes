    <p><h2><em>Ingredinets:</em> 4 Servings</h2></p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 (1 lb.) smoked ham hock</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium leeks (white and pale green parts only), thinly sliced </li>
            <li>2 large shallots, minced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add ham hock and cook, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Remove ham hock from pot and add remaining oil.</li>
            <li>Add onions, leeks, and shallots and season with salt and pepper. Cook until tender, 6 minutes more. Add split peas, broth, thyme, bay leaves, and seared ham hock and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, stirring occasionally until peas are tender, about 1 hour. (If the soup gets too thick, add water 1/2 cup at a time until desired thickness is reached.)</li>
            <li>When peas are tender, remove bay leaf, thyme, and ham hock. Remove any meat from ham hock and shred. Use an immersion blender or countertop blender to purée roughly 1/4 of the soup. Return puréed soup to pot along with shredded ham hock and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Served topped with more fresh thyme and another crack of black pepper.</li>          
        </ol>
